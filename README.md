~~TinyBasic Interpreter~~
-----------------------
ZX Basic Spectrum Interpreter (sort of) ðŸŒˆ
---------------------------------------

This was written as an exercise of manually writing TinyBasic interpreter.
...and to work on my kotlin skills.

While working on the interpreter, I came by the ["Basic Programming"](http://zxnext.narod.ru/manuals/Basic_Programming.pdf) book
which I had growing up learning basic for my ZX Spectrum 48k.

I implemented the rest of the basic needed for running the coolest program in this book:
Date to Day.

The first TinyBasic version was written in a few hours, with help from:

The ZXSpectrum work was a bit more time-consuming.

But I did it. It turns out that  I was born on a Saturday.
